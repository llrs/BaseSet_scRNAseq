title: "BaseSet and scRNAseq"
---

I build this site to show how to use [BaseSet](https://llrs.github.io/BaseSet), a package for handling sets, with scRNAseq data.

BaseSet helps to evaluate the cell type imputation. 

If you know tools about cell signatures or imputation of class or activation I would want to hear about them
